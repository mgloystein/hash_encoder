# Requirements
The project code should only import packages available in the [standard library](https://golang.org/pkg/#stdlib).
There are no super secret hidden solutions. The assignment is designed to see how you
approach writing code to solve problems. We are also looking to see code that represents your
view of “production quality”. If at any step along the way you have questions feel free to reach
out.
To submit your work please push to a public GitHub project, and be sure to document any
configuration or run instructions. We’re looking for a solution to the problem as well as attention
to detail and code craftsmanship. Good luck and have fun!
